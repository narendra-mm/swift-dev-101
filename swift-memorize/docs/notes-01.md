### _struct_
_struct_ is keyword in swift. Short for structure. In C language they hold variables. In SwiftUI, they are heart of eveything. _struct_ are pretty much eveything
in SwiftUI. There is no object-oriented programming or inheritance. It just holds variables and methods.

### _View_
A _View_ is just a rectangular area screen to draw something and can get events. Anytime you behave like something, you have two sides of a coin. 
	One is responsibility.For _View_, there is only one thing to do is to have a "body" content.
	Two is functionality. With one variable, you get a massive maount of functionality.
